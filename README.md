# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Bart

This repository contains a project on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis of influencer-led product review comments on YouTube. We have carried out zero shot classification with a BART model pretrained on the Multi genre Natural Language Inference dataset. Our Sentiment Analysis suggested that successful products should share content with the influencer videos and that brand interactions count. Two public datasets, the Yahoo answers and emotion datasets, have been used to show the potential of the model, with restricted multi - label classification: Society Culture, Science Mathematics, Health, Education Reference for topics and Joy, Love, Sadness, Anger for emotions. Moreover, a report on the project is provided.
