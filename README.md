# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Bart

This repository contains a project on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis of client comments. We have carried out zero shot classification with a BART model pretrained on the Multi genre Natural Language Inference dataset. Two public datasets, the Yahoo answers and emotion datasets, have been used, with restricted multi class classification: Society Culture, Science Mathematics, Health, Education Reference for topics and Joy, Love, Sadness, Anger for emotions. Moreover, a report on the project is provided.
